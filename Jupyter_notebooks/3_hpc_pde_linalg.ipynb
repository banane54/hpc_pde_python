    "\n",
    "Where: \n",
    "* $y^{l+1}$ is the solution at next time step:`x_new`.\n",
    "* $y^{l}$ is the solution at previous time step:`x_old`.\n",
    "* $[J_{f}(y^{l})]^{-1}$ is the inversed of the Jacobian of `x_old`.\n",
    "* $f(y^{l})$ is the resulting `S` from inputting `x_old` in the diffusion function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the inverse of the Jacobian is not readily available and is very costly to compute, we can rewrite the previous equation as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$y^{l+1} - y^{l} = -[J_{f}(y^{l})]^{-1} f(y^{l}) \\\\\n",

    "The last form of this equation: $[J_{f}(y^{l})] \\delta y^{l+1} =  f(y^{l})$ is of the form $Ax = b$. If we solve it for $x$ that is to say $\\delta y^{l+1}$, we can then get the new solution. Solving this $Ax = b$ equation can be achieved using a **matrix-free Conjugate Gradient method**. Indeed, with this method, we avoid calculating and storing directly the Jacobian. Instead, the Jacobian vector product is formed. This latter is a vector and manipulating and calculating it is easier than working with a large matrix which would represent the Jacobian on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting $\\delta y^{l+1}$, we can get the solution $y^{l+1}$ by doing $y^{l+1} = y^{l} - \\delta y^{l+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to summarize, at each time step, we will do one to several **Newton's iterations** to solve the system of non-linear equations. In each of these Newton's iterations, we will do one to several **Conjugate Gradient iterations** in order to get $\\delta y^{l+1}$ and finish the current Newton's iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come to the Newton's method in the last notebook which will be the full app. For now, we want to implemement the linear algebra part of our mini-app. This linear algebra part will be constituted of **3 functions**: \n",
    "* The norm function. \n",
    "* The dot function.\n",
    "* The matrix-free Conjugate Gradient solver function. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have already used Numpy in the past, you may think that implementing the norm and the dot functions is useless as they are already made for us in the package. However, you will see why we have to implement our own. Indeed, there is a slight difference to take into consideration, **we are using multiple processes**."

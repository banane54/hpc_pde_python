    "The problem is that, in its original form, the equation can not be solved by a computer as it is a differential equation which is continuously changing. Thus, we have to transform it a bit. We will **basically** discretize the 3 variables on which the equation is differentiated, namely, $x$, $y$ and $t$. The discretization of those variables simply means that we will restrict them on some finite domain. \n",

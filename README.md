# hpc_pde_python
This project is part of the bachelor project of Gary Folli. This is an HPC PDE solver for the Fisher's equation in python with mpi4py and numpy. This python version has been adapted from the C version of the solver written originally for the ETH summer school here: https://github.com/eth-cscs/SummerSchool2017
